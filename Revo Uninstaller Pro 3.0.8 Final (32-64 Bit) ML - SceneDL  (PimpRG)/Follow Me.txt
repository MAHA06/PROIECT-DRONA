What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a format for delivering regularly changing web content. 
RSS is a function that is supported by most torrent clients today (such as uTorrent) allowing users to automatically view and download torrents.
RSS feeds can be read using software called an "RSS reader" which can be web-based, desktop-based, or mobile-device-based.
